# Fundamentals of Data Analysis - Project 2020, by Leonard Curtin

The project itself was conducted within a jupyter notebook and written in the langauge of python version 3.8 . The working enviornment was setup using anaconda which was downloaded and installed from https://www.anaconda.com/ .

Within the contents of the jupyter notebook an explanation and implementation of linear regression occured. All of which occured under the intention of exploring and analysing the _powerproduction_ dataset.

## The following python libraries were imported and utilised throughout the course of the project
Pandas - which acts as a data manipulation and analysis tool

NumPy - a library for the Python programming language, with support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

Matplotlib - a plotting library for the Python programming language

## Various python libraries were imported using the following commands
``` python
# Commands for importing the various python libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

 - Pandas allowed for the csv file to be read, for the dataframe to be created and for summaries of the dataset to occur.

 - NumPy was used primarily for calculations regardings linear regression and polynomial regression.

 - Matplotlib allowed for the creation of vivid depictions of the dataset to occur, through the usage of its plotting functions.
